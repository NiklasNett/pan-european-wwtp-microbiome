# Supplementary Tables Overview

This folder contains supplementary Excel files generated for my Master’s Thesis *"Whole Microbiome Analyses of Wastewater Treatment Plants 
across Europe"*. Detailed information on the contents of each file is provided below:

---

## Supplementary_Table_S1.xlsx
### Sample Details
- **Sheet 1:** All samples included in the current study (collection dates, WWTP location, etc.)  
- **Sheet 2:** Unused samples (replicates) from the original study

## Supplementary_Table_S2.xlsx
### Compound Tables
- **Sheet 1:** Raw read counts per sample  
- **Sheet 2:** Relative read counts (%)  
- **Sheet 3:** Assigned genera per sample  
- **Sheet 4:** Relative abundance of assigned genera (%)

### Shannon-Wiener Indices and Relative Abundance Results
- **Sheet 1:** Bacteria  
- **Sheet 2:** Metazoa  
- **Sheet 3:** Protists  
- **Sheet 4:** Fungi

## Supplementary_Table_S4.xlsx 
### PERMANOVA Results 
- **Sheet 1:** Bacteria  
- **Sheet 2:** Metazoa  
- **Sheet 3:** Protists  
- **Sheet 4:** Fungi

## Supplementary_Table_S5.xlsx
### Plant-specific PERMANOVA Results  
- Results are organized into vertical blocks by WWTP, each containing data for all four microbial communities.
- Within each block, terms were tested individually (“by terms”) against a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix; the tested variable is indicated in the top row.
- The order of terms in the table does not necessarily reflect the testing sequence used during PERMANOVA execution.
- Significant results are highlighted in **yellow**
