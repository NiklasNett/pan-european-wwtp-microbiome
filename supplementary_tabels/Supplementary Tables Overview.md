# Supplementary Tables Overview

This folder contains supplementary Excel files generated for my Master’s Thesis *"Whole Microbiome Analyses of Wastewater Treatment Plants 
across Europe"*. Detailed information on the contents of each file is provided below:

---

## Supplementary_Table_S1.xlsx
### Sample Details
- **Sheet 1:** All samples included in the current study (collection dates, WWTP location, etc.)  
- **Sheet 2:** Unused samples (replicates) from the original study

---

## Supplementary_Table_S2.xlsx
### Compound Tables
- **Sheet 1:** Raw read counts per sample  
- **Sheet 2:** Relative read counts (%)  
- **Sheet 3:** Assigned genera per sample  
- **Sheet 4:** Relative abundance of assigned genera (%)

## Supplementary_Table_S3.xlsx
### Shannon-Wiener Indices and Relative Abundance Results
- **Sheet 1:** Bacteria  
- **Sheet 2:** Metazoa  
- **Sheet 3:** Protists  
- **Sheet 4:** Fungi

## Supplementary_Table_S4.xlsx 
### PERMANOVA Results 
- **Sheet 1:** Bacteria  
- **Sheet 2:** Metazoa  
- **Sheet 3:** Protists  
- **Sheet 4:** Fungi

---

## Supplementary_Table_S5.xlsx
### Plant-specific PERMANOVA Results  
- Results are listed in separate vertical blocks per WWTP, each covering all four microbial groups
- Each block displays terms that were individually tested (“by terms”) against a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix, with the tested variable indicated in the top    row
- The order of terms in the table does not necessarily reflect the order in which they were tested during the actual PERMANOVA runs for each WWTP
- Significant results are highlighted in **yellow**
